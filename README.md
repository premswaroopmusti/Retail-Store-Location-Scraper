# Retail-Store-Location-Scraper

As a data scientist, it's important to know how to scrape data from various sources,
including websites. 

## Task

Scrape the locations of your favourite retail brand in India and extract the following information:

- Store Name
- Address
- Timings
- Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) (bonus)
- Phone Number

Use Python programming language

Once data is extracted, store the data in a CSV file..... :)

Here are the steps that i followed:

### Approach

- I have already worked upon Web scraping, so I had a brief idea about how to approach this task.
  
- Firstly, I scraped the store name, store address, store phone number, store timings etc from 1st page of the retail store V-Mart.
  
- After that I started researching about how to fetch latitude and longitude from google map url.
  
- I tried some approaches and finally succeeded in fetching latitude and longitude
  
- Thereafter I scraped the store data from all the 18 webpages of V-mart using a (for loop).
  
- I saved everything in a csv file.

### Challenges faced

It took a little while for me to find a way for fetching latitude and longitude accurately from the google map url..

I faced some errors while dealing with data frames and lists

I resolved those errors and put my efforts to bring the desired output.
